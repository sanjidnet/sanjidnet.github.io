There 2 financial problems that economics characterizes and 
tries to solve. 

- consumption variability
- risk 

- Problem of Consumption Variability

This means that when your income is $100, you spend $100. 
When your income is $5, you spend $5. 
That's probably the most extreme case of consumption not being smooth.

- Problem of Risk 

When you go about your life the normal way but when you face a shock, 
it affects you and you have to use up maybe all of your savings. 
Risk is different from consumption smooting because 
consumption is more variable in nature and shock is more severe. 
Shock hits you hard. It's something you do not predict at all. 
It kind of knocks you out. So for a farmer, 
it would be like 2 consequtive seasons of drought. It comes to them as a 
severe shock and even savings may not be enough for them to recover from it. 

- Solution of Consumption Variability

Saving. If you save, when you have a $100 in income, you spend $50 but 
the $50 that you save, you consume that when your income is $5. 
This is a grotesque simplification but the general idea is that you are
smoothing your consumption by capitalizing on your savings. 

- Solution of Risk

Insurance. Spread out your risk by making a certain amount of payment 
on a regular basis. For example, for your car, it would be $50 a month. 
So when there is a severe damage to the car that might take $2,000 to fix, 
there is some entity that eliminates that risk for you. 
It does not even have to be an insurance company. It can be an arrangement
amongst friends. Let's say, everyone amongst a group of $10 friends such that
when someone faces severe risk, it would be contributed towards eliminating 
that risk.
